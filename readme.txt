Allow MemberPress Coupons to use the timezone you defined in Wordpress for start and expiry dates, instead of the default (UTC) timezone.

== Features ==

= Use Your Own Timezone =

When activated, this plugin will force MemberPress coupons with a start date and/or an expiry date to use the timezone setting defined in Wordpress General Settings.

By default, MemberPress uses the UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) timezone when saving the start date/time and expiry date/time of each coupon.

You can now regain control of your coupons and override this setting, allowing your coupons to start at the right time and expire at the right time, depending on your local timezone.

= Check Start / End Times at a Glance =

The MemberPress Coupon admin listing page will now show not only the date when the coupon starts or expires but also the time, relative to your own timezone setting, making it easy to see when coupons are scheduled to start and end.


== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =
* Updated JavaScript on Add/Edit Coupon page

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
